As we usher in the era of the decentralized web, the role of advanced 
blockchain technology has become increasingly critical. Starknet,
a decentralized, permissionless, and scalable ZK-Rollup, represents 
a significant step forward in this field. It has proven itself as a hero in the L2 war and significantly stands out today. 
But every hero needs a trusted companion, and for Starknet, this ally emerges as **Deoxys**.
Built on the robust Substrate framework and powered by the reliable 
might of Rust, Deoxys is the most powerful Starknet full node implementation.

In this documentation, we will learn more about its architecture, its attributes,
its specifics, and of course, how to launch your own Deoxys and benefit 
from its powers. But before we dive into that, I would like to say a few words 
about the technical prerequisites related to full nodes on Starknet and the tools 
that we are going to use.
